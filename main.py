"""
This non-linear 6DOF simulator is has been made as a sort of
minimum viable simulator without all the complexity and capability
of other simulation tools you may have found and tried to use.
It uses the flat Earth equations of motion.

It is initially set up with the same aircraft and a very similar
configuration to my aircraft stability tool found here: https://simmeon.github.io/aircraft-stability/

You should be able to compare the response from both tools and they should
(in theory, if I haven't messed up) be similar. But there will and should
be differences since this code uses non-linear equations while the website
uses linear equations of motion.

Hopefully this code is set out in a way that is readable, decently
well commented, and can help you understand the main steps that
go into an aircraft simulation.
